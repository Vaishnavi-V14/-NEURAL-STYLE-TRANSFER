Overview of the project

Project:  NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER



Objective


To implement a neural style transfer system that applies artistic styles from reference images to content images, creating visually appealing artworks by blending the content and style seamlessly.


Key Activities

•	Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess content and style images.
•	Optimization: Iteratively update the content image to minimize the combined loss.
•	Model Integration: Implement algorithms for blending content and style features effectively. 
•	Evaluation: Assess output quality visually or using style transfer metrics.
•	Deployment: Create tools or applications for users to upload images and apply artistic styles.



Technology Used

• Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), or Matplotlib for image manipulation and visualization.
•	Optimization Algorithms: Gradient Descent or Adam for iterative image optimization.
•	Compute Acceleration: GPUs or TPUs for faster processing of deep learning tasks.
•	Deployment Tools: Flask, Streamlit, or Gradio for building user-friendly interfaces.
